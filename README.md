## Running Locally

In order to get everything running you'll need the back-end web server, see the [Odin](https://github.com/YouFoundation/dotyoucore) repository to get started.

Once you have the back-end running, you can start the mobile app by following the instructions below.

### .npmrc setup for GitHub Packages

If you are installing dependencies for the first time, you may need to create a `.npmrc` file in the project root to authenticate with GitHub Packages:

```bash
echo "@homebase-id:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com" > .npmrc
echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" >> .npmrc
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with a GitHub personal access token that has at least `read:packages` scope. See [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages) for more details.

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start Metro

```bash
npm start
```

#### Log in with local identities on Android

```
# run adb as root:
adb root

# adb proxy port 443
adb reverse tcp:443 tcp:443
```

Now you can log in with local identities such as `frodo.dotyou.cloud`.

> [!Note]
> No Such configuration is required for iOS simulators.
